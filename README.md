# aws-static-website-project
 Secure, scalable static website hosted with AWS services ( S3, CloudFront, WAF, and CloudWatch )
 
# üìÅ 1. Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to securely host a fast and reliable static website using AWS services, while applying industry-level best practices.


Many developers can upload a website to AWS S3, but often overlook three critical aspects:

- Security: Preventing attacks and unauthorized access

- Performance: Ensuring global users get fast load times

- Monitoring: Tracking access and anomalies to ensure reliability

Why This Matters?

In real-world applications, slow or unsecured sites can lead to:

- User drop-off and bounce rates

- Vulnerabilities to hackers or bots

- No visibility into issues due to lack of monitoring
